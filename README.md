<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
Develop and Build an affordable and open source case for the Raspberry Pi 4 to help the users to become more productive then ever.
<img src="./ressources/images/top.png" alt="top_view">

### Starting Situation

Surfing on the net I discovered some very cool case solutions for the RPi4. I almost ordered one of those products (Argon One). But then I realized that when the RPi4 was powered by a Power Bank(almost always in my case)(5V@2.1A) the CPU had some serious throttling problems. So overclocking with this power supply was out of discussion. I searched for an alternative battery powered power supply(5.2V@3A). Without success.
At the same time I discovered some interesting "Half-solutions":
* [Argon One](https://www.argon40.com/argon-one-raspberry-pi-4-case.html) (very nice design, power button, cooling system)
* [Acrylic Raspberry Pi set-top box kit](https://wiki.52pi.com/index.php/Acrylic_Raspberry_Pi_set-top_box_kit_SKU:_ZP-0098) (all IOs on the back, full dual HDMI)
* [Raspberry Pi RGB Cooling HAT](https://www.yahboom.net/study/RGB_Cooling_HAT) (OLED dipslay with IP address, CPU temp, etc)
* [Adafruit PowerBoost 1000 Charger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2465) (UPS solution with Li-Ion cell, power supply)

So I decided to take inspiration from all this product and make my own solution! :)

### Aim
Develop and Build an affordable, open source, smart and good looking case for the Raspberry Pi 4.
Make good documentation and a building guide available to everyone so that anyone can build ther own case at home.
Find someone on github to collaborate with (I'm new on the platform).

### Product Reqirements
* Size: max double the footprint of the RPi4. Max height not defined.
* Battery: min 2 hours of battery life.
* Cooling System: capable of cooling Overclocked RPi4.
* Power Button: capable of Soft and Hard Shutdown.
* PSU: UPS, BMS and 5.2V@min 2A output supply.
* Accessible GPIOs

### Current Status
At the moment PCB V0.1 is beeing manufactured. I'm waiting for the board to start testing. In the version 0.1 only the upper board is beeing developed. The bottom PCB(only function is to take HDMI and Audio ports to the back) will be developed with Version 0.2 or 1.0 because it only need minor testing.
At the moment no Firmware or Software is in development.

# Getting Started
### Toolchain

* [Altium Designer](https://altium.com)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)
* [Autodesk Fuson 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)

### Hardware
* [Schematics](docs/pcb_schematics.PDF)
* [Assembly documentation](docs/pcb_assembly.PDF)

During hardware development two major solution where taken into considaration.
Both solutions where integrated on V0.1 in order to test both. To separate the circuits 0ohm resistors where used.
##### Always ON MCU powered by on board 3V3 Buck Boost Regolator
In this solution the MCU and the 3V3 regulator can't be turned OFF (sleep mode available). MCU wait for an interrupt triggered by a push button. Then it enables 5V2 Regulator and therefore power up the Raspberry. 
* **Downsides**
  * 3V3 Regulator and MCU still draw current when device is turned OFF.
  * Expensive(3V3 Regulator)

* **Upsides**
  * Simpler circuit
  * More reliable system

##### MCU powered by Raspberry on board 3V3 regulator
In this solution no 3V3 Regulator is needed and MCU can be turned OFF. MCU is powered by the Raspberry on board 3V3 Regulator.
By pressing a push button a capacitor is charged and the 5V2 Regulator is activated. The Raspberry and therefore the MCU are powered up. As soon as the MCU is started the 5V2 Regulator is kept enabled until the system is turned OFF. The capacitor is needed to bypass the time needed by the MCU to power up.
* **Downsides**
  * Circuit need to be tested (proof of concept)

* **Upsides**
  * MCU completely turned off when device is turned off.
  * Cheaper(no 3V3 Regulator needed)
