<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
An affordable and open source case for the Raspberry Pi 4 to help the users became more productive and portable then ever.
<img src="./ressources/images/v1.2_side.png" alt="top_view">

## Starting Situation

Surfing on the net I discovered some very cool case solutions for the RPi4. I almost ordered one of those products (Argon One). But then I realized that when the RPi4 was powered by a Power Bank(almost always in my case)(5V@2.1A) the CPU had some serious throttling problems. So overclocking with this power supply was out of discussion. I searched for an alternative battery powered power supply(5.2V@3A). Without success.
At the same time I discovered some interesting "Half-solutions":
* [Argon One](https://www.argon40.com/argon-one-raspberry-pi-4-case.html) (very nice design, power button, cooling system)
* [Acrylic Raspberry Pi set-top box kit](https://wiki.52pi.com/index.php/Acrylic_Raspberry_Pi_set-top_box_kit_SKU:_ZP-0098) (all IOs on the back, full dual HDMI)
* [Raspberry Pi RGB Cooling HAT](https://www.yahboom.net/study/RGB_Cooling_HAT) (OLED dipslay with IP address, CPU temp, etc)
* [Adafruit PowerBoost 1000 Charger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2465) (UPS solution with Li-Ion cell, power supply)

So I decided to take inspiration from all this product and make my own solution! :)

## Aim
Develop and Build an affordable, open source, smart and good looking case for the Raspberry Pi 4.
Make good documentation and a building guide available to everyone so that anyone can build ther own case at home.
Find someone on github to collaborate with.

## Product Reqirements
* Size: max double the footprint of the RPi4. Max height not defined.
* Battery: min 2 hours of battery life.
* Cooling System: capable of cooling Overclocked RPi4.
* Power Button: capable of Soft and Hard Shutdown.
* PSU: UPS, BMS and 5.2V@min 2A output supply.
* Accessible GPIOs

## Current Status (15.01.2020)
Version 1.2 of the PCB is done. Software still in alpha phase. At the moment I'm focused on the Enclosure. I'm testing different 3D printed cases for the RPi4.

# Hardware
The PCB is developed with [Altium Designer](https://altium.com).
